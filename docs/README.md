> **I recommend reading through** [Docsify Preview](https://sanjay0302.github.io/docsify-back-forth)

The **Docsify `back-forth` Plugin** adds a floating navigation bar to your documentation that is powered by Docsify.

---

## Features

- `Back and Forward Buttons`: Two pairs of arrows to the bottom right corner of the screen for navigating to the previous and next document in the history.

- `Responsive Design` and `Hover Transitions`

---

## Installation

1. Copy the plugin code into a new file, e.g., `docsify-navigation.js`.

2. Include the plugin file in your Docsify configuration, like below

   ```html
   <script src="path/to/docsify-back-forth.js"></script>
   ```

---

## Customization

You can customize the appearance of the navigation bar by modifying the CSS styles in the plugin code. The following CSS classes are available for customization:

- `.custom-nav`: Styles the overall navigation bar.
- `.nav-btn`: Styles the individual navigation buttons.
- `.nav-icon`: Styles the navigation icon (the arrow).
- `.nav-text`: Styles the navigation button text.

> For example, you can change the background color of the navigation buttons by modifying the `background-color` property in the `.nav-btn` class.

---

## Compatibility

- The plugin is designed to work with the standard Docsify navigation system. It may not work with custom navigation implementations.
- The plugin does not provide any additional functionality beyond the basic back and forward navigation. It is a simple, lightweight solution for enhancing the user experience.
